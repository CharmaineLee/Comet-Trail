Comet Trail

This program opens a window where users can put hold and drag their mouse around the screen to create a comet trail. The comet trail would fade in opacity over time. If MouseEvent is "button-down", a new dot appears at that position and all previous trails are erased.

Requires Racket Version 6.3 to run program.

Input (main empty), then press "enter" in the interactions window to initiate program.
